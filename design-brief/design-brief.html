                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">Our Artificial Intelligence software, designed with the upmost attention-to-detail and precision, holds the power to penetrate the technology market on a global scale. In fact, the scope of our technology’s influence isn’t limited strictly to business or education; it even extends beyond professional workplaces and into household use.<br><br>As you might expect, AI will reap benefits for users all across the Internet. One particular example features spam filtering. Traditional, simple rules-based filters are generally ineffective against cutting down on advanced spamming algorithms. For this reason, spam filters must continually learn from a variety of signals, adjusting their filtering settings accordingly. Luckily, AI technology holds the solution at hand. Artificial Intelligence deals heavily with learning through progressive algorithms. By repeatedly ‘training’ AI with additional information, its neural network will continually grow stronger, allowing it to develop more advanced techniques for handling spam and other attacks.<br><br>Another facet of the Internet which may be bear subject to AI technology is relating to social media and search recommendations. Much like the human brain, Artificial Intelligence is constantly widening its understanding of the human world, taking in as much information as possible through correcting its past mistakes and refining its algorithms.  Advanced computing systems made possible by AI will help consumers ‘get the most’ out of data online. Social media feed recommendations will progressively get more custom-tailored and mathematically intuitive. </p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">The advantage with training Artificial Intelligence to teach children in educational subjects is that such instruction is tailored to the child’s individual learning style and pace. While it’s true that most artificial intelligence education technologies have yet to become widespread, the potential still exists.<br><br>Artificial Intelligence, along with their advanced algorithms for collecting and analyzing data, are able to match a student with the curriculum best fit for their particular case. Rather than pushing along a whole class or grade of students at the same pace, Artificial Intelligence could pinpoint exact areas of fault and fix them before they perpetuate into bigger knowledge gaps.<br><br>With reference to teachers and parents, the applications of AI may serve to benefit them additionally. Rather than requiring a teacher to manually grade all assignments submitted by students, intelligent computing powers of Artificial Intelligence may learn to scan and read a student’s handwriting, correctly identifying the letters, integers, and symbols involved.<br><br>This information could then be compiled into a report, providing parents and teachers alike with an in-depth analysis of a student’s strongpoints and weaknesses. In many cases, a student may show signs of being afraid to speak up and ask a question when they’re lacking understanding of a subject. Conversely, intelligent algorithms may alleviate the pressure on behalf of student’s by opening up the block in communication.<br><br>Through the implementation of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) such as SHERLOCK teaching Air Force technicians or DARPA using AI to prepare Navy recruits in technical disciplines, classrooms are becoming ever-more technology-centric.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">For many professionals, industry success is defined first-and-foremost by merely ‘being in the know’, referring to having the necessary training or background experience to evaluate which career decision to next make.  However, in an era of increased globalization and technological domination, some beg the question of whether scanning the Internet for such information is truly the best use of time.<br><br>There are a few different focus areas around which AI is transforming the employment sphere. Firstly, complex AI systems may be able to detect patterns in large collections of information, analyzing mathematical nuances. Algorithmic trading builds off this idea, analyzing information to determine which stocks or companies to invest in, with a greater degree of certainty than any human is capable of. <br><br>Personal finance is largely based off of an individual’s understanding of basic algebra and fundamentals in economics. Is it really necessary for professionals to be learning these skills, however, when advanced computing systems could easily replace such operations? Personal finance and portfolio managers, analyzing monthly income, current balance, cost of living, and spending habits, hold the capability of generating customized suggestions according to your personalized career statistics. Artificial Intelligence can analyze wide trends found amongst similar professionals and can advise you with statistically-sound suggestions.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">At face value, the aviation industry is enormously complex, involving teams of hundreds of highly-qualified engineers and piloting experts. And while yes, this generalization of aircraft generally holds true, Artificial Intelligence and its applications in training simulators, mission management aids, and data analysis may revolutionize aircraft industry.<br><br>Change has already begun to take root, especially with Air Operations Divisions using AI for expert systems and simulation experiences. The foresight of stepping into an aircraft with a clear understanding of your plan is invaluable, especially when a mistake could blur the lines between life and death. The AOD’s use of such systems gives assistance to pilots live-action and before-the-fact, making determining the best possible maneuvers more manageable and ridding out uncertainties that are mathematically bound to fail.<br><br>An additional use of artificial intelligence championed by the AOD is speech recognition software. When it’s necessary for multiple pilots to communicate, especially over long distances, speech recognition can help to alleviate unclarity in voice tones and articulated the specific dialog spoken.<br><br>There are a range of other, miscellaneous uses of AI, such as NASA’s incorporation of artificial neural networks into the design of their aircrafts. No matter the circumstance, AI technology is proving truly revolutionary in even the most technically-focused fields of engineering.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">Commuting from place-to-place is another, technically-driven area with which AI has the potential to massively impact. A majority of Americans have resorted to viewing their daily commutes as tedious, but artificial systems implemented in new cars may have to alleviate their frustrations, as well as objectively improving safety and other measures.<br><br>Perhaps the first incorporation of artificial intelligence was through fuzzy logic controllers, developed for automatic gearboxes in automobiles. This device allotted greater control over the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of a malfunction in the systems of the car.<br><br>More recently, cars have emerged into production with features such as self-parking or automated cruise controls. Even mobile software in phones and other devices, with traffic optimization applications, has transformed driver’s experience entirely. While it’s true that progress has been made, it should in the least be conceded that transportation is an immensely complicated subject area, and for this reason, the design of systems should pay due acknowledgement towards this complexity. </p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">The topic of whether robotics will replace American workers is somewhat of a contentious discussion point. Even still, regardless of whether you’re in favor of such advancements, there is no denying the prevalence of new technologies in manufacturing industries, which ever since their creation have been the pinnacle of mass-testing technological innovation.<br><br>With AI’s capabilities in a high degree of precision and autonomy, previously worker-driven tasks can now be automated by machines, answering challenges stemming from quality and yield, inflexible production lien design, rising production costs, and an inability to manage capacity.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">Modern artificial intelligence technologies are the product of years-worth of engineering innovation and competitive spirit, on behalf of the thousands of researchers and developers working to advance the status quo of computing knowledge. <br><br>It is said that the discussion of artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy, a professor at Dartmouth College. In hopes of achieving a break-through toward advancing our collective understanding of human-like machines, he announced his intentions of assembling a group of accomplished computer scientists to research this emerging field of computer science. While his plans never came to full fruition, his interest in the applications of artificial intelligence set in motion a catalyst which would layer set the foundation for future computer scientists to build off his work. <br><br>As other researchers from around the globe took a deeper interest in this subject, problem-solving remained fixated on abstract problems in math and logic. It was difficult for scientists of this era to avoid falling into the habit of speculating on the basis of superstition or unsupported inference, as technology had simply not advanced far enough.<br><br>Though with years passing on, in addition to periodic programs sparking the public’s interest in AI, philosophical quandaries regarding the ethics of artificial intelligence began to emerge. The core mindset driving change in the computer science industry at this time was being able to distill human knowledge into mathematical code or to somehow abstract the complexity inherent in the human brain by breaking down the problem into smaller steps.<br><br>It was through the aforementioned style of thinking that the concepts of deep learning and neural networks dawned over artificial intelligence. Computer scientists soon realized that much like the human brain, artificial neural networks could pass data through webs of loosely wired logic, building up the system’s ability to interpret future data by analyzing the connection formed between different parts. This mathematical notion was soon connected with the concept of an actual network of neurons, and while not everyone was at first convinced, with continued experimentation throughout the mid 2000’s and into the current decade, expimre4net after experiment fueled undeniable evidence: situating us at our current understanding of AI.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">As is the case with any subject area, artificial intelligence can be subdivided into different levels of complexity. The typical ‘American’ perception of this field may fall more towards the highly complex or future-oriented study of artificial intelligence, but in actuality, this focus area is only the tip-of-the-iceberg when it comes the wider collection of AI knowledge.<br><br>The two most basic subdivisions are between Strong and Weak AI.  The latter is focused on systems designed and trained under the guise of a specific task. The only purpose of the machine is to fulfill a particular, narrow-minded role, such as a personal assistant.<br><br>Strong AI, on the contrary, is equipped with more generalized human-like cognitive abilities. The core idea behind developing a Strong AI system is that the intelligence will be able to find new solutions to unconfronted tasks. Alan Turing, a mathematician known for having made developments in computer science during the 1950s, put together a test known as the ‘Turing Test’ to determine whether or not a computer matches a human’s intelligence. <br><br>Aside from the aforementioned categorizations, AI can further be classified into another 3 subtypes. complexity inherent in the human brain by breaking down the problem into smaller steps.<br><br><strong>Relative machines:</strong> A form of weak AI which lacks the capability to make predictions towards the future, and instead uses computational power to analyze probabilities of a present situation. <br><strong>Theory of mind:</strong> The theory of mind is a step more towards the outlandish or speculative side of artificial intelligence, with robotics who are intelligent enough to makeintrospections on their own sense of self.  <strong><br>Self awareness:</strong> The pinnacle of computer science innovation, self-aware robotics would not only have an understanding of their current state, but could also use this knowledge to bridge emotional connections with others on a human-like basis.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">The use of Arrow in the Air Operations Divisions (AOD) is mainly for simulations. AI can simulate enemy operators in combat training simulators, mission management aids, post processing of simulator data into statistics, and supports systems for tactical decision making.The use of Arrow in the AOD is already proving to be very useful. Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces. Arrow can then assist pilots during air combat by providing them with the best possible maneuvers, as well as eliminating maneuvers that would be impossible for a human to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations, Arrow allows simulated pilots rather than real ones to be used to get the data. These computer simulations are also used to train future air traffic controllers.The AOD also uses Arrow for speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers (ATC) give commands to the simulated pilots and the pilots are supposed to give responses back. These programs that incorporate speech software must be trained through repeated uses, which means that they use neural networks. The continued use and improvement of Arrow is imperative in situations with speech recognition because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.Arrow has also been incorporated to run on damaged aircraft. Arrow enables the damaged aircraft to continue to fly until it reaches a safe landing zone. Arrow compensates for the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. Arrow utilizes a neural network in order to learn how best to optimize each aircraft's components. Arrow has also been developed based on an Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS). Arrow acts as an IAS, this means that Arrow behaves like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation, such as severe weather, system failure, or turbulence. To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies, Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

                    <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;font-size:14pt;">There is commonly the misconception that robots will someday gain the capacity to supercede human intelligence and abuse newly-developed emotional senses, such as anguish, fear, and revenge. In reality, most computer scientists are in consensus that these fears are overstated.<br><br>The far more likely scenarios, as some say, are centered around human malevolance, with the robots simply acting as an extension of a conscious thinker's personal agenda. Will human civilization be at the bane of overly advanced technology, enabling humans to carry out mass acts of terror? <br><br>Alternatively, some point out that some weak AI systems are programmed with such a slim degree of  freethinking, as to accidently coercing malicious action. Remember, programs simply follow exactly what they're instructed, so it's always of paramount importance to show weariness of what goes into that coding process. </p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;">Artificial Intelligence may hold a potentially astronomic impact on our economy. While there's the commonly held fear the robots will 'take' worker's jobs, there are also broader considerations, such as what resources are needed to fuel the rising production of robotical parts. <br><br>Taking up an opposing viewpoint from the aforementioned fear of robotics taking jobs, some contenders suggest that AI capabilities will enable automation of tasks previous arduous and unappealing. At the cost of disrupting the livelihood of Americans, the AI-driven mechanization may open up new opportunities for such individuals. <br><br>Alogn with this viewpoint, some say the assistance of a smart AI will create a new system for the workforce. The AI could help innovators with creating solutions to problems and with being more efficient. The existing labor and capital that we have could be used in a much more efficient way that would save millions of dollars. <br><br>As we consider the economic consequences, it's important to bear in mind a number of factors, including the loss of jobs of working in the short-run (as well as how their former roles will tarnsform), uneven distirbution of impact by AI, with regards to sectors, wage levels, educaiton, job types, and locations, as well as changes in technical skills necessary for success in an AI-driven economy.</p>

However, discussing social impacts is still an important point of discussion all the same. <br><br>The quintisencial question behind AI is of 'Man vs. Machine': whether computational intelligence will supercede human's natural, biological cognitive capabilities. In such a case, how might you image humans being treated in a society dominated by robotics, who are inherently more intelligently designed?<br><br>When considering that topic, though, you must bear in mind the technological infeasability of such a scenario. As we continue to make developments in this emerging industry, answering these questions sooner rather than later will be of key importance in advocating for the future.</p>
