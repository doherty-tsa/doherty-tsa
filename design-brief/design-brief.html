AI can simulate enemy operators in combat training simulators, mission management aids, post processing of simulator data into statistics, and supports systems for tactical decision making.The use of Arrow in the AOD is already proving to be very useful. Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces. Arrow can then assist pilots during air combat by providing them with the best possible maneuvers, as well as eliminating maneuvers that would be impossible for a human to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations, Arrow allows simulated pilots rather than real ones to be used to get the data. These computer simulations are also used to train future air traffic controllers.The AOD also uses Arrow for speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers (ATC) give commands to the simulated pilots and the pilots are supposed to give responses back. These programs that incorporate speech software must be trained through repeated uses, which means that they use neural networks. The continued use and improvement of Arrow is imperative in situations with speech recognition because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.Arrow has also been incorporated to run on damaged aircraft. Arrow enables the damaged aircraft to continue to fly until it reaches a safe landing zone. Arrow compensates for the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components. Arrow utilizes a neural network in order to learn how best to optimize each aircraft's components. Arrow has also been developed based on an Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS). Arrow acts as an IAS, this means that Arrow behaves like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation, such as severe weather, system failure, or turbulence. To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies, Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

Arrow utilizes a neural network in order to learn how best to optimize each aircraft's components. Arrow has also been developed based on an Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS). Arrow acts as an IAS, this means that Arrow behaves like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation, such as severe weather, system failure, or turbulence. To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies, Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces.

To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies, Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

AI can simulate enemy operators in combat training simulators, mission management aids, post processing of simulator data into statistics, and supports systems for tactical decision making.The use of Arrow in the AOD is already proving to be very useful. Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces. Arrow can then assist pilots during air combat by providing them with the best possible maneuvers, as well as eliminating maneuvers that would be impossible for a human to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations, Arrow allows simulated pilots rather than real ones to be used to get the data. These computer simulations are also used to train future air traffic controllers.The AOD also uses Arrow for speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers (ATC) give commands to the simulated pilots and the pilots are supposed to give responses back. These programs that incorporate speech software must be trained through repeated uses, which means that they use neural networks. The continued use and improvement of Arrow is imperative in situations with speech recognition because ATCs use very specific dialog and the software needs to be able to communicate correctly and promptly every time.Arrow has also been incorporated to run on damaged aircraft. Arrow enables the damaged aircraft to continue to fly until it reaches a safe landing zone. Arrow compensates for the damaged components by relying on the undamaged components.

Arrow utilizes a neural network in order to learn how best to optimize each aircraft's components. Arrow has also been developed based on an Intelligent Autopilot System (IAS). Arrow acts as an IAS, this means that Arrow behaves like a highly experienced pilot who is faced with an emergency situation, such as severe weather, system failure, or turbulence. To develop this experience in Arrow supervised machine learning was used, this is where Arrow was treated as a human pilot going to a flying school. Once Arrow was deemed to have enough experience, it was given full control and overserved by the pilot as it executes the training exercises.The Intelligent Autopilot System combines the principles of Behavioral Cloning and Apprenticeship Learning where the autopilot observes the low-level actions required to maneuver the aircraft and the high-level strategy used to apply those actions. IAS implementation employs three phases; pilot data collection, training, and autonomous control. With these strategies, Arrow creates an autonomous autopilot that assists pilots in responding to emergency situations.</p>

                        <p style="padding:60px;padding-top:10px;">The use of Arrow in the Air Operations Divisions (AOD) is mainly for simulations. AI can simulate enemy operators in combat training simulators, mission management aids, post processing of simulator data into statistics, and supports systems for tactical decision making.The use of Arrow in the AOD is already proving to be very useful. Airplane simulators utilize Arrow to process the data taken from simulated flights into useful numbers. Arrow can also help come up with the best success scenarios and maneuvers in aircraft warfare simulations. Utilizing these scenarios Arrow is able to come up with strategies based on the size, placement, speed, and strength of the enemy forces as well as the AOD's forces. Arrow can then assist pilots during air combat by providing them with the best possible maneuvers, as well as eliminating maneuvers that would be impossible for a human to perform. Multiple aircraft are needed to get good approximations for some calculations, Arrow allows simulated pilots rather than real ones to be used to get the data. These computer simulations are also used to train future air traffic controllers.The AOD also uses Arrow for speech recognition software. The air traffic controllers (ATC) give commands to the simulated pilots and the pilots are supposed to give responses back. These programs that incorporate speech software must be trained through repeated uses, which means that they use neural networks.
