                <p style="font-size:16pt;">Our school spirit manifests across all 7 skills of the Doherty Spartan, with special emphasis on our devotion to competitiveness. Doherty High School offers a range of competitive activities availible for students to partake in. <br><br>Whether through business-oriented programs such as FBLA & DECA, or conversely with such programs as Robotics and TSA, we provide students with the necessary activities to quell their desire to engage with their community at large.  <br><br>We are always searching for new competitive opportunities to present our students with. This is largely why our PLTW classes highly encourage attendance at local tech fairs, whether TSA-related or otherwise. <br><br>Emersing our students in such activities gives them a taste of what it's like to partake in real-world business practices.  </p>

                      The VEX Robotics Competition is a robotics competition from elementary through university students. It is a subset of VEX Robotics, which is in turn a subset of Innovation First International. <br> Our VEX Robotics chapter is a subset of TSA. This group builds and Designs robots that play against other teams in a game based engineering challenge. <br><br>Robotics, the new and growing club, is fun and exciting for our members. Everyone dreams of building robots as kids and now they actually get the chance to. <br><br>STEM concepts are used as students critically think and put together a robot. Leadership, communication, and teamwork is all very important to make sure the robot gets finished and that it works effectively. <br><br> Without the team work going on the robot would never be finished. There are tournaments which our team competes in as well as having completions with in our school.
