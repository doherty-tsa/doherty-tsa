                                    <p>Dual Credit Courses, whether they are taken at the high school where the student is enrolled, or at a post-secondary institution, are courses for which the student has been granted permission to earn both high school and college credit. Students must have prior permission to enroll for dual credit and meet the requirements specified by the college. Students are responsible for verifying any collegeâ€™s acceptance of credits earned as dual credit. <br><br>A meeting with a councelor and the student's parents, as well as ample evidence certifying that a student is qualified to take a college-level course, are generally all that's needed to secure their enrollment.</p>

                                    <p>Whereas with CU Succeed and other comparable programs, there is a certain degree of certification inherent, duel enrollment differs through the fact that there is no standard metric by which a college can evaluate the relative significance of grades at a local community college or state school. <br><br>For this reason, placement tests are more common for students falling under this critera. To prepare, a student may consider using a test-preparation service such as Accuplacer or the SAT.</p>

                                    <p>Transportation and parking are two other matters entirely when it comes to duel enrollment. Typically, a student must provide their own ride to the desired college or high school. <br><br>For this reason, duel enrollment is typically reserved for upperclassmen, who are more likely to have the necessary transportation services availible to them.</p>
